Here's a prioritized list of features and recommendations for the Language App project:

### 1. Prioritized Features for Next Sprint

1. **Add 5 more complex A2 lessons**

    - Explanation: This directly addresses a TODO item and expands the content offering, providing
      more value to users advancing in their language learning journey.

2. **Fix learning streak (shows always 0)**

    - Explanation: This is a critical bug that affects user motivation and engagement. Fixing it
      will improve the gamification aspect of the app.

3. **Implement longer audition exercises**

    - Explanation: This feature, mentioned in the TODO list, will diversify the exercise types and
      improve listening comprehension skills.

4. **Optimize app performance and minimize battery usage**

    - Explanation: This will enhance user experience, especially for mobile users, and potentially
      increase app usage duration.

5. **Implement error boundaries for robust error handling**
    - Explanation: This will improve app stability and user experience by gracefully handling
      potential errors.

### 2. Potential New Features or Improvements

1. Implement offline mode for learning without internet connection
2. Develop AI-powered chatbot for conversational practice
3. Integrate voice recognition for pronunciation exercises
4. Add customizable learning paths based on user goals

### 3. Risks and Concerns

1. **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations, especially considering user
   data storage and potential voice data collection.
2. **Scalability**: As more complex lessons and audio exercises are added, monitor server load and
   database performance.
3. **User Retention**: With the streak bug and limited A2 content, there's a risk of losing more
   advanced users.
4. **Audio Quality**: Ensure the quality and consistency of audio files generated by ElevenLabs for
   a good learning experience.
5. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Verify that new features work consistently across different
   devices and browsers.

### 4. Recommendations for the Development Team

1. **Code Quality**: Implement stricter code review processes to catch bugs like the streak issue
   earlier.
2. **Testing**: Increase unit and integration test coverage, especially for core features like
   streak tracking and exercise completion.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring tools to proactively identify and
   address performance issues.
4. **User Feedback**: Implement a system for collecting and analyzing user feedback to guide future
   feature development.
5. **Documentation**: Keep the project documentation up-to-date, especially as new features are
   added or existing ones are modified.
6. **Accessibility**: Ensure that all new features adhere to accessibility standards to make the app
   usable for all learners.
7. **Localization**: As new content is added, ensure that the Russian UI translations are kept
   up-to-date.

By focusing on these priorities and recommendations, we can improve the app's content offering, fix
critical issues, and lay the groundwork for future enhancements while mitigating potential risks.
