Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational structure of the Duolingo clone for learning Czech from Russian by implementing basic user authentication and creating the initial lesson framework.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks

### High Priority
1. Set up project environment and basic React MUI structure (3 points)
   - Initialize React MUI project
   - Set up basic routing
   - Create placeholder components for main screens

2. Implement user registration (5 points)
   - Create registration form UI
   - Set up backend API for user registration
   - Implement form validation and error handling

3. Implement user login (5 points)
   - Create login form UI
   - Set up backend API for user authentication
   - Implement JWT token generation and storage

4. Design and implement database schema for lesson content (8 points)
   - Define schema for vocabulary, grammar, and exercise types
   - Set up MongoDB database and connection
   - Create API endpoints for fetching lesson content

### Medium Priority
5. Develop basic lesson structure UI (5 points)
   - Create components for lesson overview
   - Implement lesson navigation
   - Design and implement lesson completion tracking

6. Implement multiple choice exercise type (5 points)

   - Add functionality to update basic user information

## Effort Estimation
Total story points: 34

## Dependencies and Risks
- Dependency: Task 1 should be completed before starting other tasks
- Dependency: Tasks 2 and 3 (user registration and login) should be completed before task 7 (user profile management)
- Risk: Potential learning curve for team members not familiar with React MUI or MongoDB
- Risk: Possible delays in setting up the development environment

## Definition of Done
- All code is written, reviewed, and merged into the main branch
- Unit tests are written and passing for new functionality
- All user stories meet the specified acceptance criteria
- The application runs without errors in the development environment
- Basic documentation is updated, including setup instructions and API endpoints
- All UI components are responsive and follow the initial design guidelines
- Code adheres to agreed-upon style guidelines and best practices
