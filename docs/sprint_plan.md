Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Implement the core Russian UI and basic Czech language learning functionality to
create a minimum viable product (MVP) for Russian speakers learning Czech.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks

### High Priority

1. Implement Russian UI for all components (8 story points)

    - Translate all existing UI elements to Russian
    - Ensure proper text rendering for Cyrillic characters

2. Develop core lesson structure for Czech language (13 story points)

      Russian

3. Implement interactive exercise types (13 story points)
    - Multiple choice questions with Russian instructions and Czech content
    - Fill-in-the-blanks exercises using Czech words and phrases
    - Listening comprehension exercises with Czech audio and Russian UI

### Medium Priority

4. Create responsive UI design with Czech and Russian cultural elements (5 story
   points)

    - Develop mobile-friendly layouts incorporating Czech and Russian design
      motifs
    - Ensure compatibility across different device sizes

5. Implement "Word of the Day" feature (3 story points)
    - Showcase a daily Czech word with its Russian translation
    - Include usage examples and pronunciation guide

### Low Priority

6. Implement basic analytics dashboard with metrics relevant to Czech language
   learning (5 story points)

    - Track user engagement metrics for different types of Czech exercises
    - Monitor lesson completion rates and identify challenging areas for Russian
      speakers

7. Enhance accessibility features for Russian-speaking users (3 story points)
    - Implement screen reader compatibility with Russian voice output
    - Add keyboard navigation support with Russian key mappings

## Estimated Effort

Total Story Points: 50

## Dependencies and Risks

1. Dependency: Russian translation accuracy for UI elements and lesson content
   Risk: Inaccurate translations could lead to user confusion and poor learning
   experience Mitigation: Engage professional translators or native Russian
   speakers for review

2. Dependency: Czech language content creation Risk: Delay in creating
   high-quality Czech lessons and exercises Mitigation: Partner with Czech
   language experts early in the sprint

3. Risk: Integration challenges between frontend Russian UI and backend lesson
   structure Mitigation: Regular sync-ups between frontend and backend teams

4. Risk: Performance issues with responsive design across various devices
   Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing on multiple device types and sizes

## Definition of Done

1. All selected user stories are implemented and functional
2. Russian UI is fully implemented and reviewed by a native Russian speaker
3. Core lesson structure and interactive exercises are created and tested
4. Responsive design is implemented and tested on various devices
5. "Word of the Day" feature is functional and populated with initial content
6. Basic analytics dashboard is implemented and capturing relevant metrics
7. Accessibility features are implemented and tested
8. All code is reviewed, merged, and passes automated tests
9. Documentation is updated to reflect new features and Russian UI
10. Product Owner has reviewed and approved the implemented features

This sprint plan focuses on creating a solid foundation for the Russian-Czech
language learning app, prioritizing the core functionality and user interface in
Russian. The selected tasks balance essential features with some medium and low
priority items to round out the MVP. The total story points (50) represent a
challenging but achievable sprint goal, considering the complexity of
implementing a bilingual learning platform.
