Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Implement core Russian UI and basic Czech language learning functionality to
create a minimum viable product (MVP) for Russian speakers learning Czech.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks

### High Priority

1. Implement Russian UI for all existing components (8 story points)

    - Translate all UI elements to Russian
    - Ensure proper rendering of Cyrillic characters

2. Develop core lesson structure for Czech language (13 story points)

    - Design initial lesson progression (5-10 lessons)
    - Create database schema for lesson content in Czech and Russian
    - Implement basic lesson display functionality

3. Implement multiple choice exercise type (5 story points)

    - Create exercise component with Russian instructions and Czech content
    - Integrate with lesson structure

4. Implement fill-in-the-blanks exercise type (5 story points)
    - Create exercise component using Czech words and phrases
    - Integrate with lesson structure

### Medium Priority

5. Enhance user profile management (5 story points)

    - Allow users to set learning goals in Russian
    - Implement basic progress tracking for completed lessons

6. Implement "Word of the Day" feature (3 story points)

    - Create component to display a daily Czech word with Russian translation
    - Set up backend logic to rotate words

7. Create responsive UI design with Czech and Russian cultural elements (8 story
   points)
    - Develop mobile-friendly layouts with cultural design motifs
    - Ensure compatibility across different device sizes

## Effort Estimation

Total Story Points: 47

## Dependencies and Risks

-   Dependency: Russian UI implementation (Task 1) should be completed before
    other tasks to ensure consistent user experience
-   Risk: Accuracy of Czech language content and Russian translations may
    require expert review
-   Risk: Performance issues may arise when implementing responsive design,
    especially on lower-end devices popular in Russian-speaking countries

## Definition of Done

-   All selected user stories are implemented and functional
-   Russian UI is applied consistently across all implemented features
-   Code is reviewed and merged into the main branch
-   Unit tests are written and passing for new components and functions
-   The application runs without errors on both desktop and mobile browsers
-   Basic end-to-end testing is performed to ensure core functionality works as
    expected
-   Documentation is updated to reflect new features and Russian UI elements
-   The product owner has reviewed and approved the implemented features

This sprint plan focuses on creating a basic but functional version of the
application with Russian UI and core Czech language learning features. It
prioritizes the essential components needed for an MVP while laying the
groundwork for future enhancements.
