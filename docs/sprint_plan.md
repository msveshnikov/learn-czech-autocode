    - Push notifications require mobile platform integration and user permission handling

2. **Risks:**
    - Learning streak fix may require database schema changes, potentially affecting user data
    - Achievement system implementation might need adjustments to the existing gamification features
    - Russian localization accuracy for new content needs to be verified by native speakers

## Definition of Done

-   All code is written, reviewed, and merged into the main branch
-   Unit tests are written and passing for new features
-   Integration tests are updated and passing
-   New features are manually tested on multiple devices and browsers
-   Russian localization is reviewed by a native speaker
-   Documentation (including README.md and inline comments) is updated
-   Performance impact of new features is measured and optimized if necessary
-   User acceptance testing is completed for major features (A2 lessons, achievements, streak fix)
-   Release notes are prepared for the new features and fixes

This sprint plan focuses on addressing the high-priority items from the backlog, with an emphasis on
expanding content and improving user engagement features. The selected tasks balance new feature
development with critical fixes and enhancements to existing functionality.
