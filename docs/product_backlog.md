## Notes

- The addition of more complex A2 lessons and longer audition exercises are now top priorities to expand the app's content.
- Fixing the learning streak and implementing achievements have been moved to high priority to enhance user engagement.
- Voice recognition and customizable learning paths have been added as medium priority items to improve the learning experience.
- The integration of ElevenLabs for audio tasks has been completed, so it's been removed from the backlog.
- Consider conducting user testing specifically for the new A2 level content and audition exercises to ensure they meet learner needs.
- As development progresses, continue to gather feedback on the effectiveness of the gamification elements and adjust as necessary.
- Keep monitoring app performance and user feedback to identify any emerging issues or feature requests.

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project, with a focus on expanding content, fixing critical issues, and enhancing user engagement features. The priorities have been adjusted based on the recent developments and the TODO list provided in the README.md.
