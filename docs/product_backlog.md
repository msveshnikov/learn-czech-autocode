## Notes

- The landing page (landing.html) has been added to the project structure. Consider implementing this as one of the first frontend tasks.
- As development progresses, we should regularly reassess priorities based on user feedback and testing results.
- We should start thinking about beta testing once the core features (high priority items) are implemented.

This updated backlog reflects the current project state and focuses on building the core functionality of the language learning app. The priorities have been adjusted to emphasize the development of essential features first, while keeping future enhancements in mind for later stages of the project.
