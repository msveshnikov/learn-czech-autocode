## Project Overview

This project aims to create a language learning application similar to Duolingo,
specifically designed for Russian speakers to learn Czech. The app provides an
interactive and engaging platform for users to acquire Czech language skills
through various exercises and lessons.

## Features

-   User authentication and profile management
-   Mobile-first, responsive design
-   Russian UI with localization support
-   Structured lessons covering vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation
-   Interactive exercises (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, listening
    comprehension)
-   Progress tracking and performance analytics
-   Gamification elements (streaks, achievements, leaderboards)
-   Spaced repetition algorithm for efficient learning
-   Onboarding process for new users

## Technology Stack

-   Frontend: React with Material-UI for cross-platform mobile development
-   Backend: Node.js with Express.js
-   Database: MongoDB for flexible data storage
-   Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
-   State Management: Context API
-   Docker for containerization and easy deployment
-   Nginx as a reverse proxy and static file server

## Design Considerations

-   Implement a responsive design for various device sizes
-   Use a color scheme and typography that aligns with Czech and Russian
    cultural elements
-   Optimize app performance and minimize battery usage
-   Design a user-friendly onboarding process
-   Utilize lazy loading for improved initial load times
-   Implement error boundaries for robust error handling
