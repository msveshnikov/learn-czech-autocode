## Project Overview

This project aims to create a language learning application similar to Duolingo,
specifically designed for Russian speakers to learn Czech. The app provides an
interactive and engaging platform for users to acquire Czech language skills
through various exercises and lessons.

## Features

    comprehension)
-   Progress tracking and performance analytics
-   Gamification elements (streaks, achievements, leaderboards)
-   Spaced repetition algorithm for efficient learning

## Technology Stack

-   Frontend: React with Material-UI for cross-platform mobile development
-   Backend: Node.js with Express.js
-   Database: MongoDB for flexible data storage
-   Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
-   State Management: Context API

## Design Considerations

-   Implement a responsive design for various device sizes
-   Use a color scheme and typography that aligns with Czech and Russian
    cultural elements
-   Optimize app performance and minimize battery usage
-   Design a user-friendly onboarding process
